Interview Questions Seen
- Question about promises
- Question about async processes
- 

Ways we would prepare on our own:
- Leetcode (questions grouped and categorized)
  - Get the basic stuff down. More important than complicated stuff.
- Handwriting datastructures on a notepad/whiteboard pseudocode. Drawing structure.
- 

Ways to prepare as a group:
- Explain things to a group of peers first
  - Feedback (you don't make sense)
- Conceptual question swap (no pseudocode questions). Explain a thing.
- Code review meetup bi-monthly (live). Explain in person.
  - Walking through it over a call.
- Chat/skype roullette over a specific technical topic (person is interviewer the other is the interviewee)
- Anki flashcards
