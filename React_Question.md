# Star Rating System

## Goal

The goal of this assessment is to evaluate your capabilities with React, familiarity with modern web development practices, and code cleanliness.

## Problem Statement

Implement a 5-star rating system (like you would use on Yelp or Uber). When you click on one of the stars, it will fill that star and all the stars up until that one (i.e. when you select the third star, the first, second, and third stars become filled).

You should implement this using React and in the project scaffolding provided. You have up to 2 hours to complete the assessment but do not feel compelled to spend the full 2 hours if you complete the assessment early.

Please attempt this problem by completing the following requirements in order. Even if you do not complete all the requirements, please submit what you have.

### Requirements

1. Displays 5 empty stars.
2. When you click on a star, it will fill that star and all the stars up until that one. The remaining stars stay empty.
3. When the user hovers over a star, it will fill or highlight that star and all the stars up until that one.
4. Make total number of stars dynamic based on a prop passed into the RatingSystem component.
5. When the user clicks the same star twice, it resets the selected stars.
